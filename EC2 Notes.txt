1.What is EC2, Why do we need EC2 service in cloud computing ?

Ans.Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a cloud computing platform that provides hosted virtual machines to run applications. It is a part of Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a collection of cloud computing services offered by Amazon. EC2 allows users to launch virtual servers on demand and manage security, networking, and storage.EC2 in cloud computing provides scalable, cost-effective, and flexible virtual servers, allowing users to easily adjust computing resources based on demand, optimizing costs, and providing quick, on-demand access to computing capacity. 

2.Features of Amazon EC2 ?
Ans.Auto-scaling: Amazon EC2 can automatically scale up or down to meet demand, ensuring that you have the right amount of compute capacity at all times.
Instance types: Amazon EC2 provides a wide range of instance types with different CPU, memory, and network configurations to choose from.
Global infrastructure: Amazon EC2 provides the ability to place instances in multiple locations. Amazon EC2 locations are composed of Regions and Availability Zones. Availability Zones are distinct locations that are engineered to be insulated from failures in other Availability Zones and provide inexpensive, low latency network connectivity to other Availability Zones in the same Region.
Secure and resizable compute capacity: Amazon EC2 provides secure and resizable compute capacity in the cloud. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage.
Key Pair for instance security: Amazon EC2 uses public-key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login information. Public and private keys are generated in pairs and the private key is kept secret.

3.What is Hypervisor ? and its types ?
Ans.A hypervisor is a software that enables virtualization, which is the creation and management of virtual machines (VMs) that run on a single physical machine. A VM is a simulated computer system that behaves like a real one, with its own operating system and applications. A hypervisor allows multiple VMs to share the same hardware resources, such as CPU, memory, disk, and network, without interfering with each other.
There are two main types of hypervisors:

Type 1 hypervisor: This type of hypervisor runs directly on the hardware of the host machine, without any underlying operating system. It is also called a bare-metal or native hypervisor.
Type 2 hypervisor: This type of hypervisor runs as a software layer on top of an operating system on the host machine. It is also called a hosted or embedded hypervisor.

4.EC2 Instance state ?
Ans.pending: The instance is preparing to enter the running state. An instance enters the pending state when it is launched or when it is started after being in the stopped state.
running: The instance is running and ready for use. You can connect to your instance and use it as you would use a computer sitting in front of you.
stopping: The instance is preparing to be stopped. This may take a few minutes depending on the instance type. You can restart a stopped instance at any time.
stopped: The instance is shut down and cannot be used. The instance can be started at any time. You are not charged for the instance usage while it is stopped, but you are charged for the storage of any Amazon EBS volumes attached to the instance.
shutting-down: The instance is preparing to be terminated. This may take a few minutes depending on the instance type. You cannot restart a terminated instance.
terminated: The instance has been permanently deleted and cannot be started. You are not charged for the instance usage after it is terminated, but you may be charged for any resources associated with the instance, such as Amazon EBS volumes or Elastic IP addresses.

5.How many types of EC2 Instance-State codes ?
Ans.There are six types of EC2 Instance-State codes, which represent the status of an instance. They are:

0: pending - The instance is preparing to enter the running state.
16: running - The instance is running and ready for use.
32: shutting-down - The instance is preparing to be terminated.
48: terminated - The instance has been permanently deleted and cannot be started.
64: stopping - The instance is preparing to be stopped.
80: stopped - The instance is shut down and cannot be used.

6.What is the meaning of server hibernating mode ?
Ans.Server hibernating mode is a power-saving feature that allows a server to enter a low-power state when it is not in use. In hibernating mode, the server saves its system state to a file on the disk and then shuts down completely. When the server is needed again, it can resume from the file and restore its previous state. Hibernating mode can help reduce energy consumption and costs, as well as prolong the lifespan of the server hardware.

7.What is KMS ?
Ans.AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is a product of Amazon that helps administrators to create, control and delete keys, which encrypt the data stored in AWS products and databases. You can use AWS KMS to protect your data with symmetric or asymmetric encryption, sign and verify messages, generate data keys and HMAC codes, and manage the lifecycle of your keys. AWS KMS integrates with most other AWS services that encrypt your data, such as S3, RDS, and Secrets Manager.

14.What is elastic IP ? & WHY were we used ?
Ans.An Elastic IP (EIP) is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing environments. It is associated with your AWS account rather than a specific EC2 instance.
Static IP Address:

Purpose: Elastic IPs provide a static public IP address that you can assign to your AWS resources.
Re-assignable:

Purpose: Elastic IPs can be associated and disassociated from EC2 instances, providing flexibility.
Preventing IP Address Changes:

Purpose: Helps avoid changes in public IP addresses when instances are stopped and restarted.
Public-Facing Services:

Purpose: Ideal for hosting public-facing services that require a fixed IP address.

15.What is the snapshot of why we use it ?
Ans.A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of your data, such as an EBS volume or an EC2 instance. You can use snapshots to back up your data, restore your data in case of a failure, or migrate your data across regions and accounts. Snapshots are stored in Amazon S3, and are incremental, meaning that only the changed blocks of data are stored in each snapshot. This makes snapshots cost-effective and efficient. You can also encrypt, share, and archive your snapshots.

18.Difference between Security Group & NACL ?
Ans.NACL operates at the subnet level and applies rules to both inbound and outbound traffic individually.
Security group operates at the instance level and applies rules to both inbound and outbound traffic together.
NACL is stateless, meaning it does not keep track of the connection state and requires explicit rules for both directions of traffic.
Security group is stateful, meaning it maintains the connection state and allows the response traffic back regardless of the rules.
NACL is an optional form of protection, while security group is a required form.

19.How many IP Addresses can we attach to the instances ?
Ans.Private IP Addresses:

Each EC2 instance in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is automatically assigned a private IP address from the IP address range of the subnet to which it belongs.
You can also manually assign additional private IP addresses to the instance within the same subnet.
Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs):

Each EC2 instance can be associated with one or more Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs).
Each ENI can have multiple private IP addresses assigned to it.
Public IP Addresses:

By default, instances launched in a public subnet are assigned a public IP address.
The number of public IP addresses you can assign depends on the instance type and the size of the subnet.
IPv6 Addresses:

Instances in a VPC can be assigned IPv6 addresses in addition to IPv4 addresses.
The number of IPv6 addresses you can assign depends on the instance type and the size of the subnet.


20.How many types of volume states do we have ?
Ans.Creating:

The volume is in the process of being created. This state occurs when you have initiated the creation of a new EBS volume.

In-Use:

The volume is attached to an EC2 instance and is actively being used by that instance.
Deleting:

The volume is in the process of being deleted. This occurs when you have initiated the deletion of an EBS volume.

21.What is a key pair, and its types ?
Ans.In Amazon Web Services (AWS), a key pair is a set of security credentials that consists of a public key and a private key. Key pairs are used for secure communication and authentication with instances, typically Amazon EC2 instances. The public key is stored on the instance, while the private key is kept secure by the user. 
Amazon EC2 Key Pairs:

Description: These key pairs are used for SSH (Secure Shell) authentication when connecting to EC2 instances.
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Access Key Pairs:

Description: IAM users can have access key pairs (access key ID and secret access key) for programmatic access to AWS services via APIs.
AWS Key Management Service (KMS) Key Pairs:

Description: KMS generates and manages key pairs for encryption purposes.

22.What is load balancer and its types ?
Ans.a load balancer is a service or device that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed with too much load. The primary goal is to enhance the availability and reliability of applications by evenly distributing requests among healthy servers. Load balancing can be crucial for scaling applications, improving performance, and ensuring high availability.

Application Load Balancer:
 This type of load balancer makes routing decisions at the application layer (HTTP/HTTPS) and supports path-based routing. It can route requests to one or more ports on each container instance in your cluster. Application Load Balancers support dynamic host port mapping, which allows you to have multiple tasks from a single service on the same container instance1.

Network Load Balancer: This type of load balancer makes routing decisions at the transport layer (TCP/SSL) and can handle millions of requests per second. It uses a flow hash routing algorithm to select a target from the target group for the default rule. It forwards the request without modifying the headers. Network Load Balancers also support dynamic host port mapping.

Classic Load Balancer:
 This type of load balancer operates at both the request level and the connection level. It balances the load across multiple Amazon EC2 instances and supports either EC2-Classic or a VPC. Classic Load Balancers do not support dynamic host port mapping.

Gateway Load Balancer: This type of load balancer is designed to deploy, scale, and manage third-party virtual appliances such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and deep packet inspection systems. It operates at the third layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model and supports both TCP and UDP protocols. Gateway Load Balancers use Geneve encapsulation to preserve the original source and destination IP addresses of the packets.

23.Features of Load Balancers ?
Ans.Distribution of Traffic:

Description: The primary function of a load balancer is to evenly distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers or resources.
High Availability:

Description: Load balancers enhance the availability of applications by directing traffic away from unhealthy or failed servers to healthy ones.
Scalability:

Description: Load balancers facilitate the scaling of applications by allowing the addition or removal of servers dynamically.
Health Checks:

Description: Load balancers regularly perform health checks on servers to determine their availability and responsiveness.

25.What is a Health Check ?
Ans.In EC2, a health check is a mechanism used by an Auto Scaling Group to determine the health status of its instances. It ensures that only instances that pass the health check are considered healthy and can receive traffic. The health check verifies that instances are responsive and operating as expected based on defined criteria, such as successful HTTP responses or custom scripts.

26.what is group of LB ?
Ans.a group of LB might mean a set of instances managed by an Auto Scaling Group that are load-balanced by one or more Load Balancers to distribute incoming traffic and ensure high availability.

Handles HTTP requests.
Manages static content delivery (HTML, images).
Examples: Apache, Nginx.
Application Server:
Executes business logic, handles dynamic content.
Supports application components (EJB, servlets).
Examples: Tomcat, WildFly, WebSphere.

28.What is the target group ?
Ans.In AWS, a target group is part of the Elastic Load Balancing service. It is a logical grouping of targets (such as EC2 instances) that receive incoming traffic from the load balancer. The target group routes requests based on configured rules, helping distribute traffic and manage the health of the registered targets.

29.How many types of the Scaling option ?
Ans.Vertical Scaling (Scale Up/Down):
Scale Up: Increase the capacity of an existing instance by adding more resources (CPU, memory).
Scale Down: Decrease the capacity by removing resources from an existing instance.
